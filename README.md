# Crop-yield-Prediction-using-Python

Overview
This project focuses on predicting crop yields by leveraging a dataset specifically chosen for its relevance and potential insights into agricultural trends. The primary objective in Stage 1 involves selecting an appropriate project, followed by a detailed exploration and manipulation of the crop yield prediction dataset, sourced from reputable databases like Kaggle and UCI.

Project Phases
1. Project Definition, Requirements, and Expectations
Selection of Project: After reviewing various datasets, the crop yield prediction dataset was selected due to its relevance and potential for insightful analysis.
Objective: The initial phase encompasses understanding the project's scope and what is expected to be accomplished in Stage 1.
2. Data Acquisition, Governance, Curation, & Source Code Management
Data Overview: An in-depth exploration of the dataset was conducted to gain a preliminary understanding and uncover underlying stories within the data.
Tools & Languages: Python was chosen as the primary programming language for its versatility and robust library support for data analysis.
3. Data Shaping and Carpentry
Data Cleaning: Adhering to the principle of not assuming data cleanliness, an examination for null or NA values was conducted, followed by column renaming for better readability and removal of unnecessary columns.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization
Data Insight: This critical step involved utilizing various visualization tools (pie charts, line graphs, correlation heatmaps, and bar/box plots) to explore and select important features from the dataset, facilitating a deeper understanding of its dimensions.
5. Statistical/Machine Learning Model Planning, Building, and Testing
Model Development: The process included creating training and test datasets, followed by the application and step-by-step evaluation of two different machine learning models.
6. Model Validation, Visualization, and Interpretation
Evaluation: Three distinct error measures were calculated to validate the models effectively. The models were then visualized for an enhanced interpretation of the results.
7. Data Story
Insights and Conclusions: Key findings and success rates were discussed, highlighting the global trends in crop yield patterns and providing a comprehensive concluding statement.
8. Model Deployment and Monitoring
Future Directions: Acknowledging the dynamic nature of the project, it was noted that there are several aspects for future exploration, such as analyzing data beyond 2013 and incorporating factors that have a direct or indirect impact on crop production.
Expectations for Future Work
This project opens several avenues for further research and development, including the integration of more recent data and the examination of additional variables affecting crop yields. Continuous model monitoring and updating with new data will be crucial for maintaining the relevance and accuracy of the predictions.

Conclusion
The Crop Yield Prediction Project aims to provide valuable insights into agricultural trends and help in making informed decisions to improve crop yields effectively. By systematically approaching each phase of the project, from data acquisition to model deployment, we aim to contribute significantly to the field of agricultural data science.
